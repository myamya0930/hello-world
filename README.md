Hi Everyone,
There is Mya (another version of Mia), Chinese college student new for programming.
I start this simply because of the new programming class I am taking.
Actually, programming is a fancy thing to learn to do. 
It will be really cool if I can manage it.
My major is psychology and programming is kind of like the necessarity for our student.
I haven't met many teachers since I started to have programming class.
On the one hand, I believe it's cool to have someone push us to learn something important.
While on the other hand, I find it cooler to have the passionate from ourselves.
What can I do under the compulsory system, adapting is always the first job to do for Chinese student.
However, I really love study.
